This Power BI project focuses on analyzing a detailed call center dataset, which includes features such as Call ID, Agent, Date, Time, Topic, Answered (Y/N), Resolved, Speed of Answer (seconds), Average Talk Duration, and Satisfaction Rating. The objective is to extract meaningful insights into call center performance, customer satisfaction, and emerging trends.

## Problem statemnet

- Overall calls answered/abandoned.
- Calls by time.
- Average speed of answer.
- Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered.

## Datasource :
  Dataset used for this task was presented by [Pwc](https://www.pwc.in/) and call centre trends dataset:

  Dataset: Call Centre Trends

## Data Preparation:
   Completed the Data transformation in Power Query and the dataset loaded into Microsoft Power BI Desktop for modeling.

   Call Centre Trends dataset is give table named:

     - Call Center trends dataset which has 10 columns and 5000 rows of observation.

   Data Cleaning for the dataset was done in the power query editor as follows:

    - Removed Unnecessary columns.
    - Removed Unnecessary rows.
    - Each of the columns in the table were validated to have the correct data type.

## Data Modeling:

- The call centre table as show below
